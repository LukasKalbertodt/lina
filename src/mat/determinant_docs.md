Returns the determinant of this matrix. This number gives a general idea
of whether the transformation represented by this matrix squishes or
stretches space. If this is 0, the transformation's output space has a
lower dimension than the input space and thus, the matrix is non-invertible.
See [this video][1] for a good explanation.
